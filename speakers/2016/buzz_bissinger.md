<p> Harry Gerard "H. G." Bissinger III, also known as Buzz Bissinger, is an acclaimed, award winning American journalist and author.

After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972, Bissinger began his journalism career. It was in 1987, during his time at The Philadelphia Inquirer, that Bissinger won the Pulitzer Prize for reporting an investigative series on corruption in the Philadelphia court system.

A year later, Bissinger moved to Odessa, Texas and wrote Friday Night Lights (1990), the book for which he is perhaps best known. The New York Times number one bestseller that has sold roughly two million copies documents the impact of high school football on small-town life and served as the inspiration to numerous films and TV series. 

Bissinger wrote A Prayer for the City (1998), another New York Times bestseller titled Three Nights in August (2005), Shooting Stars (2009), a sequel to Friday Nights Lights titled After Friday Night Lights (2012), and a memoir titled Father's Day (2012).

Bissinger has been a contributing editor at Vanity Fair magazine since 1996 as well as a longtime contributor to The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Philadelphia Inquirer. In the July 2015 Vanity Fair cover story “Call Me Caitlyn”, Bissinger exclusively chronicled Bruce Jenner’s gripping transition from Olympic decathlete to transgender woman, one of the biggest stories in recent years. 

Bissinger, his wife, Lisa, and their three sons, divide their time between homes in Philadelphia and the Pacific Northwest. </p>
