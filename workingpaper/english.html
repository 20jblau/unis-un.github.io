<h2>A Letter from the Co-Chairs</h2>
<p>Dear Participant,</p>
<p>
We'd like to take this moment to thank you for coming to this year's conference, and to introduce ourselves and the rest of the UNIS-UN organizing and executive committees. Ms. Sylvia Gordon founded UNIS-UN in 1976 at the United Nations International School. She wanted to create an event in which her students and visiting students could meet to discuss pertinent world issues. Over the years UNIS-UN has evolved into the largest student-run conference held in the United Nations General assembly, with over 500 students attending from 5 continents. Every year we begin planning in April by interviewing and selecting the Executive Committee. This is the core planning body for the conference. We are then divided into 6 commissions: Editing, Finance, Logistics, Visiting Schools, Speakers, and Technology. Together we work with the over 100 UNIS students making up the Organizing Committee to plan all aspects of the conference, from website design and social media presence to speaker and participant invitations and more. We've worked hard to plan a marvelous experience for you, and we are so excited to welcome you to our city.
</p>
<p>Here's to a wonderful conference!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Sarah Blau and Sean Waxman-Lenz</p>

  <h2>Foreword</h2>
  <p> The U.N. defines an international migrant as “any person who changes his or her country of usual residence.” There is an estimated 191 million immigrants in the world, a number that is almost twice what it was 50 years ago. 60% of the world’s migrants live in developed countries1. Beginning in 2015, large amounts of refugees have crossed the Mediterranean Sea and Southeastern European borders to apply for asylum within the European Union. Since then, the political climate has become less welcoming and migrants have been used more are more as scapegoats for economic and security issues. Following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Donald Trump’s election to the United States presidency, and Italy’s vote to a referendum on its EU membership, the world a rise in nationalist and populist rhetoric.</p>
  <p> Human rights, economic policy, refugee health and national sovereignty are some of the concerns surrounding immigration. The issue is only growing as economic, political and environmental instability continue to rise and more men, women and children are forced out of their homes.</p>
  <p> At this year’s UNIS-UN conference - Migration: Crossing the Line - we will have the unique opportunity to hear from speakers that are actively involved in fighting for immigrant justice. This year, we will be hearing from Angy Rivera, Gregory Maniatis, William Milberg, Sirin Selcuk, and Ben Fox Rubin. These speakers have contributed to the international dialogue on migration throughout their careers, and some of them have experienced what it is to leave home and immigrate to a country not necessarily welcoming. Alongside the anti- immigration movement is a movement by the people for reform and acceptance. The goal of this year’s conference is to examine varying perspectives on the issues surrounding migration: the causes, individual experiences as well as the political and humanitarian responses to migration. As millions of people flee their countries to escape armed conflict, political turmoil and economic hardships, we will consider who is responsible for providing aid and to what extent. While we may not find express answers to these issues, we hope to lead a discussion that can result in a deeper understanding of global migration.</p>
