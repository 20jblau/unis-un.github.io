  <h2><b>A Letter from the Co-Chairs</b></h2>
<p>Dear Participant,</p>
<p>
We'd like to take this moment to thank you for coming to this year's conference, and to introduce ourselves and the rest of the UNIS-UN organizing and executive committees. Ms. Sylvia Gordon founded UNIS-UN in 1976 at the United Nations International School. She wanted to create an event in which her students and visiting students could meet to discuss pertinent world issues. Over the years UNIS-UN has evolved into the largest student-run conference held in the United Nations General assembly, with over 500 students attending from 5 continents. Every year we begin planning in April by interviewing and selecting the Executive Committee. This is the core planning body for the conference. We are then divided into 6 commissions: Editing, Finance, Logistics, Visiting Schools, Speakers, and Technology. Together we work with the over 100 UNIS students making up the Organizing Committee to plan all aspects of the conference, from website design and social media presence to speaker and participant invitations and more. We've worked hard to plan a marvelous experience for you, and we are so excited to welcome you to our city.
</p>
<p>Here's to a wonderful conference!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Sarah Blau and Sean Waxman-Lenz</p>

  <h2><b>Foreword</b></h2>
  <p> The U.N. defines an international migrant as “any person who changes his or her country of usual residence.” There is an estimated 191 million immigrants in the world, a number that is almost twice what it was 50 years ago. 60% of the world’s migrants live in developed countries1. Beginning in 2015, large amounts of refugees have crossed the Mediterranean Sea and Southeastern European borders to apply for asylum within the European Union. Since then, the political climate has become less welcoming and migrants have been used more are more as scapegoats for economic and security issues. Following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Donald Trump’s election to the United States presidency, and Italy’s vote to a referendum on its EU membership, the world a rise in nationalist and populist rhetoric.</p>
  <p> Human rights, economic policy, refugee health and national sovereignty are some of the concerns surrounding immigration. The issue is only growing as economic, political and environmental instability continue to rise and more men, women and children are forced out of their homes.</p>
  <p> At this year’s UNIS-UN conference - Migration: Crossing the Line - we will have the unique opportunity to hear from speakers that are actively involved in fighting for immigrant justice. This year, we will be hearing from Angy Rivera, Gregory Maniatis, William Milberg, Sirin Selcuk, and Ben Fox Rubin. These speakers have contributed to the international dialogue on migration throughout their careers, and some of them have experienced what it is to leave home and immigrate to a country not necessarily welcoming. Alongside the anti- immigration movement is a movement by the people for reform and acceptance. The goal of this year’s conference is to examine varying perspectives on the issues surrounding migration: the causes, individual experiences as well as the political and humanitarian responses to migration. As millions of people flee their countries to escape armed conflict, political turmoil and economic hardships, we will consider who is responsible for providing aid and to what extent. While we may not find express answers to these issues, we hope to lead a discussion that can result in a deeper understanding of global migration.</p>

<div id="debate">
  <h2><b>Debate Topic I:</b></h2>
  <h3>Refugees can be denied entry if accepting them poses a security risk.</h3>
  <p>In debating this topic we encourage students to look at what qualifies as a legitimate reason for limiting migration. Rhetoric regarding the dangers of accepting refugees has spread around, but how real are the concerns? Does a country have an obligation to help people across the globe in the name of human rights when it could come at a cost to its own citizens? We hope to look into answering these questions and learning in depth about the political and moral implications of a refugee crisis.</p>
  <br>
  <h2><b>Debate Topic II:</b></h2>
  <h3>Economic migrants and political refugees should be treated equally when applying for immigration.</h3>
  <p>Today’s mass migrations have resulted in problems with countries selecting whom they can accept as immigrants. This debate topic considers how a government should make these decisions. Many people feel the moral obligation to accept refugees ends with dyre circumstances for migration. Some argue that this is inhumane as it leaves many suffering around the world. The goal of this topic is to critically assess the ethics and practicality of different immigration policies.</p>

        <h2>Why Do People Emigrate?</h2>
        <h3>Krithika Ravishankar</h3>
        <p> Human migration is the process where individuals enter the boundaries of a country of which they are not citizens with the intention of becoming a permanent resident. Currently, over 70 million people have been forced out of their native countries due to problems such as political turmoil, poverty, climate change, unemployment, and developmental projects, creating a massive refugee crisis. However, social conditions reflected in governmental corruption, poverty, environmental degradation, and political turbulence (manifested in endemic terrorism or structural violence) can also provide manmade incentives for voluntary emigration. Despite the numerous hurdles and dangers faced by migrants, the prospect of a better future, extensive opportunities, safety from violence, and availability of jobs, compels many individuals and families to leave their native land.</p>
        <p> The Guardian reported that 15 million people have been forced to migrate from their homes due to the construction of an infrastructure and an urban renewal push; this especially affects poor people as their rural neighborhoods are further industrialized. For example, in the Philippines, The Metro Manila railway project led to the ejection and displacement of an estimated 35,000 families. In Turkey, a 12-year-old Syrian boy named Saddam who lived in an abandoned shop works 12 hours shifts daily for $2 a day. People like Saddam face a Hobson’s choice (taking everything available or leaving it) since their income is not enough to get them smuggled to Europe (costing between 1,000 and 6,000 dollars), but their current lifestyles do not sustain their basic necessities.</p>
        <p> Similarly, in Eritrea, two thirds of teenagers who are forced into the military are paid 500 nakfa (10 dollars) monthly and are not legally allowed to leave. Strict laws, dictatorship and countless human rights violations have caused 1 in 50 Eritreans to flee to Europe since 2012. 9% of 400,000 who have escaped, have died or became stranded along the way, and thousands have drowned in the Mediterranean. This statistic shows us that despite the dangers, people are willing to risk their lives in search of better living conditions.</p>
        <p>Efforts for urbanization have led to displacement of lower income families. For example, in Sudan, a 40-year civil war and rapid urbanization (despite lack of trade, resources and industries) have caused 1.6 million people to be displaced. In 2016, in Juba, the South Sudan capital, a conflict erupted between the president (Salva Kiir) and vice president (Riek Machar) when Machar was accused of planning a coup. This gory conflict provoked the movement of 185,000 citizens in just one month (July 2016). While urbanization sparks advances in technology, transportation, communication, it also displaces a lot of people. Urbanization has also driven globalization. The nature of migration has been greatly influenced by globalization. The economies of the world have become more connected, and as a result, the disparity between developed and developing countries has increased. In 1900, the ratio between the income levels of the 5 richest and 5 poorest countries of the world was 9:1. Now that ratio is 100:1, which causes an increasing incentive for migration from developing countries to developed countries. In fact, from 2000-2005 developed countries received 13.1 million migrants from developing countries.</p>

        <h2>Who are the Migrants?</h2>
        <h3>Anya Patel</h3>
        <p> In 2015, there were 244 million migrants globally and each migrant has a certain profile. A profile is composed of a particular gender, age, origin, ethnicity, and education level. In 2015, the world consisted of 126,115,435 male migrants and 117,584,801 female migrants. According to the United Nations Population Division most migrants, both female and male, were ages 30 to 34 and there were less migrants of ages 70-72 internationally. This shows that there are more migrants of working age. Nonetheless, the origins and ethnicities of migrants vary. Between 1990 and 2015, the size of the international migrant stock grew in 169 countries or areas and minimized in only 63. Over 51% of all international migrants were living in 10 countries: the United States of America, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, France, Australia, and Spain. </p>
        <p> The United States has the largest number of international migrants, hosting 47 million migrants. It was reported that 11.1 million of those migrants were unauthorized immigrants. 8 million of which were a part of the workforce. English is the third most common language in the world, with 360 million speakers. However, amongst immigrants English is not a common language. Most people migrating from Latin America to North America experience troubles with the change in languages. In California alone, one the largest states to host Latin American immigrants, the most common language spoken amongst immigrants is Spanish. It was reported that 53% of the immigrant population speak Spanish at home and 20% of whom report to not speak English at all.</p>
        <p> With the increasing amounts of migrants in the United States and Europe there is a higher demand to prepare these migrants to engage in society by the means of education. In 2014, there were 10.5 million immigrants in the United States who had a college degree or higher. The Immigration Act of 1990 allowed immigrants to come to the United States, on a temporary visa, to receive a higher education. This has helped to increase the number of immigrants, between 1990 and 2000, by 89% from 3.1 million to 5.9 million. More recently, between 2000 and 2014 the number has increased by 78% from 5.9 million to 10.5 million. This shows that more immigrants are receiving a higher education and have a better opportunity to enter the workforce. Similarly in Europe, there are increasing amounts of migrants completing a lower secondary education. Specifically, 35.5% of the non-EU-born population has received at least lower secondary education, which is 14 percentage points higher than the EU-born and 16 percentage points higher than the native-born.</p>
        <p> There are migrants all around the world with different profiles: different ages, genders, origins, ethnicities, and levels of education that reside in a country other than their birthplace. From the data, we can see that the most common profile of a migrant is a male of working age (30-34).</p>

        <h2>What is the Economic Climate in Countries Preffered by Immigrants?</h2>
        <h3>Olivia Nelson</h3>
        <p> “Urbanization” has become an especially relevant phenomenon in our global, economically inter-dependent world. Stemming from the industrialization of the 19th and early 20th centuries, “urbanization” describes the progressive concentration of a country’s populations in cities and towns, with the objective of creating central areas for economic prosperity. It is predicted that, by 2030, the number of individuals living in urban areas will increase to 5 billion people. Cities undergoing successful urbanization with improved infrastructure (such as efficient transportation, education, and health facilities) and cultural advantages attract further immigration. Migrants traveling to industrialized countries often emigrate from poorer, rural regions in search of a better education, employment, or security. In addition, migration to urban areas transpires as a result of growing opportunities. Foreign migrants often view urban centers in developed nations as having increased economic opportunities, while also accommodating greater individual freedom – an alternative to exploitation and human rights violations that are rampant in much of the emerging world.</p>
        <p> There is a strong correlation between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the extent of urbanization in a country. Urbanization is generally associated with “development.” Developed urban countries typically have a high GDP –an asset that appeals to economic migrants in search of high-paying jobs. The United States of America, with a Gross Domestic Product of approximately $18.5 trillion, and an unemployment rate of 4.7%, is a popular destination for migrants. There are approximately 46.6 million migrants, mostly from Mexico, India, and China, living within U.S. borders. Mexican migrants comprise the largest population of immigrants in the United States, approximating at 12,050,000 people.</p>
        <p> The GDP in 2015 of European countries serving as common destinations for migrants follows a trend consistent with that of the United States, and are listed as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>France: $2.419 trillion</li>
          <li>United Kingdom: $2.858 trillion</li>
          <li>Spain: $1.199 trillion</li>
          <li>Germany: $3.363 trillion</li>
          <li>Sweden: $495.62 billion</li>
        </ol>
        <p> The UK, Spain, France, Germany, and Sweden – prominent destinationcountries for migrants – have low-income inequality and Gini Coefficients, an index designed to measure income distribution throughout a state. This is predominantly a result of a “progressive tax system” in which the wealthy are taxed at a higher proportional rate than low-income individuals. As an example, for 2016, individuals earning an income of $9,275 are considered to be in the “low tax bracket,” paying on average a 10% income tax rate; compared with individuals receiving incomes between $9,275 and $37,650 who are taxed at a marginal rate of 15%, and those earning between $37,650 and $91,150 who are taxed at a marginal rate of 25%. A progressive tax system effectively reduces income inequality within countries, decreasing marginal utility of income, and providing an incentive for increased spending. </p>

        <h2>What are the Routes Travelled by Migrants and How do They Navigate the Borders?</h2>
        <h3>Olivia Nelson</h3>
        <p> War and humanitarian crises often force migrants into neighboring countries to await the termination of conflict in their home countries, expecting eventual return. For these reasons, approximately 4.8 million Syrian refugees have settled in the neighboring countries of Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. Despite there being a direct relief in these nearby destinations, countries are not always readily available for refugees. In Jordan, integration within the native population has been a difficult process, with both tertiary healthcare and education becoming increasingly unattainable for refugees who are often segregated in refugee camps. Additionally, given that many of these countries are are considered “developing,” the lack of economic opportunity, along with the increasing number of refugee arrivals, has had critical effects on the economies of the host countries. The sustainable infrastructure and resources offered by nations bordering Syria are somewhat limited, this leads to strict local restrictions on refugees, and facilitates a culture of transience with migrants attempting to travel to secondary countries where, if granted asylum, they can experience safety from conflict.</p>
        <p> The Central Mediterranean route to Italy from Libya is a common path taken mostly by Nigerian, Eritrean, and Guinean migrants into European territory. However, this route became less popular due to political instability in Libya in the aftermath of the Libyan revolution. With no central government in Libya, violence prevailed. Smugglers took advantage of this failed state, openly exploiting refugees, and ultimately leading to a shift in migration patterns from the Central Mediterranean route to an Eastern Mediterranean route, after a reported 3,212 deaths in 2016. The Mediterranean route from Turkey to coastal Balkan states such as Greece and Bulgaria, then onward to Northern Europe, became the most desirable route for migrants traveling primarily from Syria and Afghanistan -- two countries immersed in ongoing conflicts. However, by 2016, as the refugee crisis continued to escalate, Macedonia, Slovenia, Serbia, and Croatia (four Balkan states), closed their borders to slow the rapid flow of migrants into the European Union. This action occurred in response to an agreement ratified by the European Union and Turkey, that enabled the EU to gain more control over their borders by returning non-asylum seeking migrants in Greece back to Turkey, while permitting Syrian refugees residing in Turkey to enter the EU. This was controversial and has been criticized by various humanitarian organizations, primarily for creating unsustainable conditions among refugees forced to remain in Greece as a consequence of being prevented from reaching northern Europe. However, migration through the Western Mediterranean from Morocco to the coast of Spain, has additionally been a fairly unpopular route for migrants. This recently has been due to the relatively high unemployment rates in Spain (approximately 22.7% of the workforce in 2015), and stricter coastal border control, exemplified through the installation of “SIVE maritime surveillance system”, and frequent vehicle checks.</p>
        <p> This past year, over one million refugees have applied for asylum in European Union member states, partially funded by $150 million from the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). With adequate resources and the safe appearance presented through news outlets, Europe appears to many migrants as the ideal destination, where they may easily find employment in the robust economies. Germany, one of the European Union’s most economically powerful states, accepted 1.1 million refugees in 2015. Asylum applications in Germany have been processed at an exponential rate, permitting more migrants to enter the country. However, with more migrants traveling to the EU, member states have become considerably attentive, increasing the role of FRONTEX - a form of border control responsible for many roles, some of which include monitoring migratory flows into the EU, and executing rescue operations at sea.</p>
        <p> FRONTEX has additionally remained active in confronting human smuggling across borders. Smuggling, an increasingly global issue, presents many ethical concerns. Criminals seeking monetary gains often exploit migrants, forcing them to travel for long periods of time in small spaces, through treacherous locations (such as deserts), or in dangerous rubber vessels that are susceptible to sinking. Technology has contributed immensely towards the continuation of smuggling. Smuggling networks often promote themselves through social media outlets such as Facebook, presenting images, detailed logistics pertaining to the routes of travel, and the prices of smuggling. However, technology does possess several advantages over migration, allowing people in host countries, and foreign aid organizations to remain updated and aware of where migrants are, and the routes that are traveled.</p>
