<h2>A Letter from the Co-Chairs</h2>
<p>Dear Participant,</p>
<p>
We'd like to take this moment to thank you for coming to this year's conference, and to introduce ourselves and the rest of the UNIS-UN organizing and executive committees. Ms. Sylvia Gordon founded UNIS-UN in 1976 at the United Nations International School. She wanted to create an event in which her students and visiting students could meet to discuss pertinent world issues. Over the years UNIS-UN has evolved into the largest student-run conference held in the United Nations General assembly, with over 500 students attending from 5 continents. Every year we begin planning in April by interviewing and selecting the Executive Committee. This is the core planning body for the conference. We are then divided into 6 commissions: Editing, Finance, Logistics, Visiting Schools, Speakers, and Technology. Together we work with the over 100 UNIS students making up the Organizing Committee to plan all aspects of the conference, from website design and social media presence to speaker and participant invitations and more. We've worked hard to plan a marvelous experience for you, and we are so excited to welcome you to our city.
</p>
<p>Here's to a wonderful conference!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Sarah Blau and Sean Waxman-Lenz</p>

Beginning in 2015, large amounts of refugees have crossed the Mediterranean Sea and Southeastern European borders to apply for asylum within the European Union. Since then, the political climate has become less welcoming and migrants have been used more are more as scapegoats for economic and security issues. Following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Donald Trump’s election to the United States presidency, and Italy’s vote to a referendum on its EU membership, the world a rise in nationalist and populist rhetoric
