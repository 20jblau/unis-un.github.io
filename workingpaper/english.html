  <h2><b>A Letter from the Co-Chairs</b></h2>
<p>Dear Participant,</p>
<p>We'd like to take this moment to thank you for coming to this year's conference, and to introduce ourselves and the rest of the UNIS-UN organizing and executive committees. Ms. Sylvia Gordon founded UNIS-UN in 1976 at the United Nations International School. She wanted to create an event in which her students and visiting students could meet to discuss pertinent world issues. Over the years UNIS-UN has evolved into the largest student-run conference held in the United Nations General assembly, with over 500 students attending from 5 continents. Every year we begin planning in April by interviewing and selecting the Executive Committee. This is the core planning body for the conference. We are then divided into 6 commissions: Editing, Finance, Logistics, Visiting Schools, Speakers, and Technology. Together we work with the over 100 UNIS students making up the Organizing Committee to plan all aspects of the conference, from website design and social media presence to speaker and participant invitations and more. We've worked hard to plan a marvelous experience for you, and we are so excited to welcome you to our city. </p>
<p>Here's to a wonderful conference!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Ayesha Wijesekera and Noëlla Kalasa</p>

  <h2><b>Foreword</b></h2>
  <p>Technology, innovation, and the future of work are changing the fundamental nature of how we function. There is an estimated 0.8 to 1.4 percent annual increase in which automation has the potential to raise productivity level globally. Technology has the ability to enhance businesses by reducing errors, improving efficiency and quality. As the tech revolution continues to flourish, 2018 will come to see new innovations that will change our evolution. According to a study by the World Bank, it is estimated that 57% of most current jobs will become automated in 20 years time. This will mean that automation will not only rattle job security, but will also increase unemployment. Even though new innovations can replace jobs, it can also create opportunities that help industries thrive and promote innovation. In the past 25 years, one-third of the new jobs established ‒ that did not exist before ‒ were in areas that included development in technology such as, Information Technology (IT) development and hardware manufacturing. Financial technology startups have reached over $22.3 billion in funding which is a 75% increase from the previous year.  <p> Human rights, economic policy, refugee health and national sovereignty are some of the concerns surrounding immigration. The issue is only growing as economic, political and environmental instability continue to rise and more men, women and children are forced out of their homes.</p>
  <p>As technology is progressively incorporated into our daily lives, it becomes increasingly important for us to understand and evaluate the political repercussions, the changing employment patterns in different groups, and the societal changes. At this year’s UNIS-UN conference, Under CTRL: Technology, Innovation and the Future of Work, we have invited a series of speakers who we hope will further expand your knowledge on how technology will affect our present world and how it will transform our future. The goal of this year's conference is to consider varying perspectives on the impact technology has on the world. In doing so, we will have to evaluate the positive and negative consequences technology has on society and the role we have in the matter.</p>

<div id="debate">
  <h2><b>Debate Topic I:</b></h2>
  <h3>Security is more important than privacy.</h3>
  <p>In debating this topic we encourage students to consider data collection. To what extent do telecommunications companies have the right to store client data? Should governments have access to citizen GPS and communication information all the time? Only in the case of an investigation? Is constant surveillance, even of persons who pose no threat, necessary for our security? These are some of the questions we hope debaters will address when arguing for or against this motion.</p>
  <h2><b>Debate Topic II:</b></h2>
  <h3>Artificial intelligence will have a destructive effect on society. </h3>
  <p>In debating this topic we encourage students to consider the benefits and disadvantages of developments in artificial intelligence. Should the decisions made my AI have more weight than human decision ? Will artificial intelligence be able to solve humanitarian and ethical issues? Will reliance on artificial intelligence increase inequality as communities who cannot afford it will fall behind? Can artificial intelligence surpass human intelligence? Does AI pose an existential threat to human intelligence? Should a limit be set on the reach of artificial intelligence? These examples are some we hope you will address while preparing their debate. </p>

        <h2><b>How has Automation Evolved and Affected Society?</b></h2>
        <h3>Sora Kanosue</h3>
        <p>Two hundred years ago, in the midst of the 18th century, the world was revolutionized with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, when new methods of manufacturing transformed the way in which products were manufactured. Now the world is once more being transformed, this time with what is being termed the Third and Fourth Industrial Revolutions. The Third Industrial Revolution, or the Digital Revolution began in the 1980s, when manufacturers around the world began to digitalize the machines they used to make their products. Even as the Digital Revolution continues to influence how products are made, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0, promises to completely alter our world, as futuristic technologies such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things are integrated into society and everyday life.</p>
        <p>One of the most significant ways in which the modern Industrial Revolutions are influencing industry is the introduction of automated industrial robots to manufacturing industries. In this regard, South Korea is taking the forefront in automating its industry, as measured by robot density. Robot density is a measure of how integrated robots have become in the manufacturing industry of a particular country as measured by the number of industrial robots there are for every 10,000 workers. In terms of this metric, South Korea is paving the way for the rest of the world, with a robot density of 531. It is followed by Singapore (396), Japan (305), and Germany (301), which are trailed by a number of European countries, Taiwan, and the United States. However, from another perspective, some other countries are also paving the way in sheer volume of industrial robots. In this regard to this statistic, China’s manufacturing industry is miles ahead of the next most proliferant country, with 87,000 industrial robots in 2016 set to jump to 210,000 by 2020. The next four countries with the highest number of robots used in industry in 2016 are South Korea (41,373), Japan (38,586), the United States (27,504), and Germany (20,039).</p>       
        <p>While automation might be transforming the way in which products are manufactured around the world, it is also paving the way for a major transformation of the daily lives of the general population of the world as well. The most significant example of this is the Internet of Things, or IoT, the network of physical appliances around the world which are connected to other networks such as the Internet in order to allow the remote transfer of data. Examples of these are devices like smart fridges, self-driving cars, and smartphones. In 2017, there were estimated to be about 8.4 billion devices connected to the Internet of Things, more than enough devices to go around for every person on Earth. The most common application of these devices is in the manufacturing and business industries in order to collect data to make industry more efficient. The second most widespread use of IoT implements is in the healthcare industry, where they are used to remotely monitor the conditions of patients and to ensure that they get the medication that they need. The IoT is also used in the field of security, for purposes such as facial and biometric recognition sensors. In all these different sectors and more, spending on the Internet of Things is set to at least triple, and even quintuple for industries like advertising by 2020.</p>
        <p>Even as it is set to explode, the Internet of Things has already penetrated many facets of our daily life. In 2016, the number of people using smartphones, which are IoT devices, exceeded 2 billion, and continues to grow every year. Many office and apartment buildings use IoT devices as security measures for those entering and exiting. In recent years, IoT devices have become common even in cars, as manufacturers collect performance data in order to improve their products. One of the most large scale applications of the Internet of Things are Smart City projects that have been implemented around the world, including right here in New York City. These IoT devices are used to collect data on different infrastructure systems such as traffic patterns, water usage, and waste management. All this information is analyzed and interpreted in order to identify optimal usage of resources and reduce costs for these cities. With the scale and ubiquity of automation both in industry and in daily life, it is mind boggling to think about how it will grow in the coming years.</p>

        <h2><b>How is Artificial Intelligence Advancing Around the World?</b></h2>
        <h3>Lea Chambadal</h3>
        <p> First introduced by computer scientist John McCarthy in 1955, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has since developed immensely into a broad term that involves everything spanning from robotic process automation to physical robots. Artificial Intelligence is generally known as the capability of a computer to perform a series of human related tasks. These tasks can be split into two general categories, weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI involves systems that are developed to replicate or surpass human intelligence, in order to be able to do a specific task in a highly precise manner. On the contrary, strong AI consists of systems that are created to have general human cognitive abilities, and when faced with a problem would be able to find a solution.</p>
        <p> Essentially, systems of strong AI are aimed to be able to replicate any human related task, while systems of weak AI are aimed to to be able to replicate a certain human related task. Researchers for both of these categories of Artificial Intelligence are continuously working on improving systems by increasing scale, speed, and the degree of autonomy of their products. Today, the market for Artificial Intelligence is dominated by two major sub-categories. The first is autonomous robots (31% of the market), a form of strong AI, which includes products like self-driving cars and hospital robots. The other main sub-category dominating the AI market is digital assistants (30% of the market), a form of weak AI, which includes automated systems such as Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa. Many countries are involved in the development of Artificial Intelligence, however some are more ahead than others.</p>
        <p> Countries can be classified as more important in the development of Artificial Intelligence based on certain factors: how many patents they have obtained, the funding available, and how many major companies they have that are developing Artificial Intelligence. Looking at the amount of patents that were given out between 2014 and 2015, we can see that the United States is in the lead with 1550 published patents. China has the next highest amount with only 306 published patents between 2014 and 2015. However, to see what countries will most likely take front in the next couple years for Artificial Intelligence the amount of money given by venture capitals and the government can give us an accurate sense on what countries are most invested. The United States currently has the highest venture capital at 10 billion dollars given to Artificial Intelligence research. However, China has also recently published their plans for the next 12 years in which the funds given for Artificial Intelligence have been raised by 190%. They are aiming on building a Artificial Intelligence industry that would be worth 150 billion dollars. Other notable countries that are competing in the AI industry are Russia, Japan, Estonia, Canada and Israel. The competing countries in AI are all first world countries that have strong research facilities and powerful companies, which are both dedicated to developing new AI systems. Additionally to this, Artificial Intelligence will be increasingly used in companies for example for cyber security.</p>
        <p> The value of the worldwide Artificial Intelligence value is predicted to increase from $643 million in 2016 to $36.8 billion in 2025. This is directly correlated to how Artificial Intelligence will be more present in our daily lives as well as how new developments will be increasingly used by companies. One notable example important to our daily lives, is the increasing number of self-driving cars being developed and the current semi-autonomous cars being sold. Semi-autonomous cars are already being produced by companies like Tesla, BMW, Infiniti, and Mercedes-Benz. This will possibly decrease the need for public transportation as self-driving taxis would be approximately seven times cheaper. Additionally to this, Artificial Intelligence is being used by companies and banks as a form of cyber security as it effectively is able to identify threats and respond to them. Many companies use Big Data which is the ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data and is often stored on online databases. However, by using these online databases the data is subject to hackers.</p>
         <p>It is clear to see that Artificial Intelligence will be increasingly present in our daily lives and that the precision at which AI systems will work at and the variety of AI available are going to increase immensely in the coming years.</p>

        <h2><b>Digital Assistance: Bitcoin, 3D Printing & Drones</b></h2>
        <h3>Kresten Due</h3>
        <p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent. Revenues from AI are expected to reach anywhere between $35.8 billion to $59.8 billion by 2025. Furthermore, it is predicted that by 2020, 85% of customer interactions with enterprises will be facilitated primarily by AI. Approximately 8% of all US households already have a smart speaker (Amazon Echo or Google Home), a number which is expected to grow by 67% by 2020. AI will have many positive effects, some of which can already be seen today. Google’s predictive search function uses AI and a variety of inputs to determine what you’re likely to search. Facebook can notify you of pictures you are tagged in and can recognize faces with 97.25% accuracy (humans have an accuracy of 97.53%)! AI is also offering the ability to diagnose medical issues without the presence of a medical professional. These technologies are only scratching the surface of what AI is capable of. On the other hand, there is fear of a “Matrix-esque”, a future controlled entirely by AI. Should AI be able to invade and record our privacy? It is too early to tell what the effects of an AI revolution will be.</p>
        <p> Another large trend in technology is the delocalization of things. Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning to damage banking. There are currently 16.8 million BTC in circulation, worth approximately $275 billion. Bitcoin uses the blockchain, which allows currency to be tracked and prevents fraud. Furthermore, through innovative use of transferring and money generation processes (mining) bitcoin has created a very valuable, though very volatile currency. Increased use of bitcoin will decrease regulation of capital, will allow for more seamless and efficient online interaction, and decrease the power of central banks. On the other hand, bitcoin is speculative and risky and it is currently extremely unstable. Will the bubble burst? It is also completely anonymous and an increase in its use may lead to the emergence of new illegal markets. Some such already exist such as the “Silk Road”, an online marketplace for illegal goods. What else will be delocalized? More mainstream markets have already gone under this change; a process primarily lead by Amazon.</p>
        <p> Technology is undergoing significant upheaval ranging from growth in 3D printing to advancements in the drone industry. Sculpteo, a 3D printing service, released its findings about the technology: 72% of its clients expect their spendings on the technology to increase. It is predicted that by 2020, 2.4 million 3D printers will be shipped (182,000 were shipped in 2015) and that the global market for 3D printers will grow to $22.4 billion. With new developments, it is possible that 3D printing could replace other forms of manufacturing. This reality is becoming more plausible now that 3D printing is no longer reserved for plastics, but can also be used for different metals and compounds. 3D printing will likely be used in the production of customized goods like 3D printed shoes, which has already been made by Adidas. Similarly, the market for drones is experiencing an extreme increase in production. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimates that 2.5 million drones regularly fly over American skies. In 2020, that number could almost triple, with 7 million drones projected to be active.</p>
        <p> Technology is constantly evolving. One year’s state of the art machine is obsolete by the next. While the aforementioned fields seem promising, it is entirely possible that they will all turn out to have minimal use beyond what they can do now or it might completely change the way we live. The only way to figure out what will happen, is to wait and see.</p>

        <h2><b>What are the Consequences of Technology?</b></h2>
        <h3>Juan Carlos Pena</h3>
        <p> The evolution of technology has changed society in both positive and negative ways. Technology has simplified the access to many tools people need in education, medicine, communication, transportation, etc. It has allowed for the advancement of knowledge and research in many areas of study around the world; especially in genetics, astronomy, physics, and even other unconventional areas. It is important to be informed of the advancements that may lead to the surpassing of human capabilities by robots and it is vital to know the consequences and repercussions it holds on worldwide society. These advances will no doubt drastically change the way we live our lives.</p>
        <p> The most influential technological advancement taking place in the present day often involve events that take place in the routines of average people. This affects daily actions, like commutes, leisure time, drives, and learning accessibility. According to the MIT Technology Review, 2017 was a year that brought many technological innovations to the aforementioned daily routines. Amongst the most notable of technological advances are self driving cars and trucks, and practical quantum computers. Self driving cars and trucks will to an extent be able to remove the issue of human error when transporting goods while increasing productivity. In fact, it is predicted that automation could raise productivity growth globally by 0.8 to 1.4 percent annually from 2015-2065. A practical quantum computer is a specialized piece of technology that is in the process of being completed. However, once all the pieces come together, quantum computers could potentially increase the computing power of many non-governmental corporations and could expand their capabilities in research, which has not been previously accessible to the masses. Quantum processing will allow work that usually takes years to complete and will reduce it to a matter of simply a couple of minutes. What these computers could process in a second, a normal computer can't even handle in a lifetime.  </p>
        <p> Eventually, enough technological advances will lead to machines to become smarter than their creators. This takes importance in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machines equipped with AI are currently handling huge amounts of data and will soon be able to analyze certain situations and act accordingly to find the best solutions. These types of machines will soon have more reasoning capabilities superior to that of humans by 2029, according to HP’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Artificial Intelligence may also be a useful factor in the administration of hacking or data breaches. In fact, HP’s CTO stated that the Equifax hacking scandal, which affected the privacy of 120 million people, would have been better solved and responded to if AI had been implemented into the management services.</p>
        <p> A new way of thinking has emerged about the future solely based on the presumption that the human race, in its current form, will continue to progress further. It is known as transhumanism, where the combination of technology and human biology will be able to overcome many limitations to the human conditions such as thinking capabilities, restoring limbs, and enhancing abilities such as strength and stamina. Without going as far as this thinking, technology in the broader aspect can eliminate diseases, provide affordable products to the world’s poorest, and enhance the quality of life. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 is a genome editing tool that enables organisms to respond and eliminate invading genetic material. According to the U.S National Library of Medicine, genetic engineering will become cheap and compelling, allowing humans to be immune to certain types of diseases. Writer Eric Drexler stated in his book, Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation, that ever since the 17th century, scientists are finding new ways to allow technology to manipulate our human body. These technological innovations will change the future as we know it.</p>
        <p>The consequences of advancing technology has many social and political implications. Artificial Intelligence will have social consequences in the sense that people will fear that technology will be misused, fear that it will create inequality, and fear that it will play with the morals and ethics of society. A public opinion poll found that 56.3% of voters are not afraid of intelligent machines, but are afraid of how humans will use the technology. The McKinsey Global Institute released statistics indicating that 48% believed the rise of AI would negatively affect blue and white collar workers, leading to higher levels of inequality. Artificial Intelligence is also politically polarizing, as it serves as a national threat. It can be used as a military tool in warfare, but can also be seen as a threat by some nations. Will this mean that governments will have to implement specific legislation in order to ensure that AI will properly be used within the ethical standards of the nation?</p>
        <p>Current day technological advances are extremely beneficial in enhancing the human scope; however, developing technological innovations that surpass human skills bring in social and political questions.</p>

    <h2><b>What is Technology’s Impact on the Environment?</b></h2>
    <h3>Isabelle Jaber and Luna Maki</h3>
    <p> Nowadays, technology drives innovation. It touches many areas of our world from medicine, to fashion, to food, to the government, but most importantly it has been—to a certain extent—crucial to promoting productivity and environmental sustainability. In recent years, workers have been producing 47% more than 20 years ago; however, in the process of doing so, they are generating more waste and requiring more power consumption than ever. This is due to the development of robots, advanced manufacturing, automation, and computerized systems. The United Nations has calculated that producing the average computer and monitor requires 530 pounds of fossil fuels, 48 pounds of chemicals, and 1.5 tons of water. Although producing technology (as well as discarding it) has detrimental effects to the environment, it benefits society in numerous ways. Computers, phones, and other pieces of technology have improved lifestyle and productivity, not to mention developed technology that also helps our environment to convert energy. But, we have to ask ourselves: does technology do more harm than good to the environment?</p>
    <p> Advances in farming technology have led to cheaper and more diverse food options. However, technological advances that improve production, such as pesticides and chemical fertilizers, also harm the environment. Modern fertilizers do increase yields, but they linger in the local environment, damaging soil and groundwater and creating “dead zones” in lakes and oceans. Pesticides may kill the pests that affect crops, but it also kills beneficial insects and animals, and can build up a population of pesticide-resistant insects that will damage future yields. Industrial livestock farms contain massive cesspools that store animal waste. They have been known to leak nitrates, dangerous microbes, and drug-resistant bacteria into nearby waterways. When these byproducts get into local waterways, they cause toxic algae which deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life. High levels of nitrates in drinking water can cause spontaneous abortions and bacteria outbreaks that are responsible for several diseases across the United States.</p>
    <p> Though technology has its adverse effects during use, study shows that 81% of the energy a computer expends is during production, according to the United Nations University. In other words, it takes more energy to create a computer than it takes to run the computer for its entire working lifetime. That makes computers different than other household appliances, which tend to use more energy during their running lifetime than in production. But what happens when there is no more use to that piece of technology? What takes place when your computer gets too old? The U.S. exports 50% to 80% of its e-waste to poor Asian countries for “recycling”. We discard 20 to 50 million tons of “technotrash” worldwide every year, which amounts to about 5% of all solid waste. This ‘technotrash’ is processed by poor workers in rural towns in places like China and India. They expose workers and their communities to shocking levels of toxic materials, turning towns into contaminated dumps. However, there are not enough workers to break down and “recycle” unwanted technology especially with the increasing trend of waste that is being produced. For example,152 million mobile devices were thrown away in 2010 and only 11% were collected for recycling. </p>
    <p> Nonetheless, there are some forms of technology that are making an impactful difference on the environment. The recent pressing issue of rising carbon dioxide emissions has called for a major technological breakthrough to capture CO2 to slow down global warming. In the past years, 40 billion metric tons of CO2 have been discharged into the atmosphere annually. This number is no surprise due to the new innovations our modern world has invented. 2 billion cars and trucks, thousands of coal-fired power plants, and billions of tons of mined coal, oil, and natural gas are some of the components that make up the CO2 in the world. This affects a wide range of events, from meltdowns in the Arctic, to thawing glaciers worldwide, to unstable weather, and to rising sea levels. However, technological breakthroughs have started to reverse the pollution that has been done to this world. In fact, U.S. emissions of CO2 are now back down to levels last seen in the last decade of the 20th century. </p>
    <p>Technology has had multiple effects on the environment: some are negative, some are being used to keep the effects of climate change at bay, and others are vitally important. Technology is a key agent in affecting how the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 3, 6, 9, 13, 14 and 15 will be accomplished. Using technology effectively and efficiently will help to accomplish these goals, thereby improving the quality of life for billions of people all around the world.</p>

    <h2><b>How Accessible is the Dark Web? </b></h2>
    <h3>Femke Teunissen</h3>
    <p> The Internet is a much bigger platform than most people probably have realized. When we use the Internet we can only see 4% of the available information. The other 96% of the Internet consists of the dark web and the deep web, which are not accessible through standard search engines. The dark web, also known as the hidden web or the invisible web, is only accessible with special software. The deep web is the opposite of the surface web, and it is known to be 500 times larger. The deep web and the dark web are not indexed, thereby making them invisible to the public. </p>
    <p> The dark web is a small part of the deep web that is not easily accessed and requires additional private information and authorization. The dark web is found on darknets and overlay networks and requires certain software. A software that is commonly used to access the dark web is the Tor browser. Tor helps users access pages on the dark web that have a “.onion” extension, while disguising the user’s identity by routing traffic through a complex network of servers. It is the most popular and well known network of its kind, and it is used worldwide by over 750,000 Internet users every day. Over half of Tor users are located in Europe. Italy, in particular, accounts for over 76,000 users a day and the United States has over 126,000 people accessing the Internet through Tor daily. </p>
    <p> Since the dark web acts as a cloak, it appeals to certain groups or individuals. It helps with illegal activities, such as child pornography, drug trade, firearm trade, and the dealing of credit card information. The Silk Road, a black market for drug and weapon trade, was shut down in 2013. It was one of the most famous cases of the use of the dark web. The Silk Road was owned and operated by Ross Ulbricht, who was arrested shortly after the shut down of the site and is currently serving a life sentence in prison. In fact, cybercrime is a big business that is projected to grow to $600 billion this year, outpacing any other form of crime, according to the the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. However, technology continues to evolve and law enforcement has cracked down on accessing these black markets on the dark web and applying appropriate punishments to those responsible. For example, the joint operation to shut down Hansa and Alphabay, the two biggest dark web markets, required both the America’s FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Dutch police to effectively terminate these sites. As a result, they were able to obtain the postal addresses of over 10,000 dark web users. </p>
    <p> According to Jonathan Wadsworth, a British author, there is no correlation between changes in the less skilled (defined as those who left school at age 16) native youth NEET (not in education, employment or training) rate and changes in the share of immigrants, from 2004 to 2012. Countries that experienced the largest rise in immigrant influx experienced neither larger nor smaller increases in native-born unemployment. There is little evidence of a strong correlation between changes in wages of all the UK natives and the changes in local area immigrants over this period. With this data, we can reconsider the claim that immigrants pose threats to social security and hurt local economies.</p>
    <p>In addition, the dark web is also used for other “non-illegal activities”. For example, the U.S. government surveillance program used the dark web as their channel to communicate with the media and the media used the dark web to avoid being caught. Furthermore, in countries with large media crackdowns the dark web can be used to access these websites. In China, this is a way for the Chinese citizens to circumvent the Great Firewall. It has also been extremely prevalent during the Arab Spring. In Iran, Tor users soared to around 40,000 in 2012 from 7,000 in 2010. Similarly, the number of users of Tor in Syria have also dramatically increased from 600 to 15,000. The dark web is becoming more mainstream and big companies are starting to utilize it more. This is primarily because everyone is becoming more concerned about privacy, especially online. In turn, this could mean that eventually everyone will be using it for either illegal or legal purposes</p>

    <h2><b>Assimilation: How Does Migration Affect the Migrants?</b></h2>
    <h3>Krithika Ravishankar</h3>
    <p> Assimilation into a new environment involves the ability to establish a steady lifestyle (i.e.: find a job, buy a home, etc.), but this process is tougher on some migrants than others. Some are highly educated and qualified, but face issues such as racism, while others face tribulations as their lack of language skills and qualifications inhibit them from finding work. Those with simple vocational abilities will find greater difficulty competing with natives for work, as well as with the emerging technologically industrialized world.</p>
    <p> Many European businesses simply find hiring refugees as an unwise business decision, according to UNHCR. Additionally, refugees entering the job market without qualifications will simply not be able to compete with European natives as well as other, more experienced migrants. Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) of Germany’s Federal Labor Agency claims that only 13% of migrants (from places such as Syria, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Albania, Serbia) hold tertiary degrees, and that they have at least a 30% chance of being unemployed in Germany. In Sweden only 5% of jobs available are low-skilled, as majority of Swedes are highly educated; we see similar statistics in Germany (9%) and Spain (16%). Through the immersion of technology, low-skilled jobs are slowly being replaced by machinery, which poses a threat to low-skilled migrants, as finding work and establishing a stable lifestyle becomes more difficult. A political implication of this could involve an increased number of immigrants on welfare.</p>
    <p> On another note: currently, migrants of all qualifications face social difficulties that further suppress their efforts to integrate. For example, France: a country with a large Muslim population; the French are not responding well to the incoming and existing refugees. Based on a 2013 survey, 70% think there are too many foreigners staying in France. Many of these migrants stay in public housing complexes separated from cosmopolitan cities, which are often ramshackled and visibly unappealing. The crime rate is high and young men are constantly victims of police brutality and are referred to as immigrants, despite some being born in France. Many migrants suffer from blatant racism that causes immense psychological stress and physical harm, violating their basic human rights and safety. In 2015, only 57% of the people in age of working were employed compared to 65 for the natives. Additionally, ethnic minorities face employment discrimination as they are only hired for the lowest paying jobs, under subpar conditions. France does have laws against employment discrimination, but Huffington Post reported that these laws do not prevent employers from victimizing migrants.</p>
    <p> To aid migrants (especially those who are low skilled), countries such as Sweden are currently operating two-year programs for migrants to help them assimilate and “build their new lives.” The effectiveness of these programs is controversial, as some think this time period is too short for unskilled migrants and too long for educated migrants. In a short period of time, complete assimilation into new counties is not possible due to the many factors that need to be taken into consideration: the time it takes to find work, the time taken for the migrants to recover from psychological trauma, the amount of training to acquire skills for work, the sheer number of migrants the government needs to help and many more.</p>

    <h2><b>What are the Ethnic Makeups of Host Countries?</b></h2>
    <h3>Ceren Powell</h3>
    <p> There are many countries that have recently taken initiative in assisting refugees from around the world. Countries such as Canada, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom are ranked highly in allowing refugees into the country. In addition to the Western countries there are countries worldwide, for example Japan that have provided assistance to migrants. The population makeup of these countries can be described as homogeneous or heterogeneous. A country is considered homogeneous if the majority of the population is of the same ethnicity. A diverse, multicultural population is labeled heterogeneous.</p>
    <p> Countries such as the United States (until 2016) and the United Kingdom appear to be more inclined to support refugees due to the diversity of their communities. In 2015, the United States had near-record where 14% of the country’s population was foreign-born, 61% was White, 18% was Hispanic, 13% was Black, 6% was Asian, 1% was American Indian and Alaska native, and 2% was of two or more races. On the contrary, Japan is a country with a population that really does not show any influence on the number of immigrants. Japan has a population of 98.5% Japanese, 0.5% Korean, 0.4% Chinese, and 0.6% other. In 2015, approximately 3% of Japan’s population was immigrants. There is a clear, significant message between the comparison of Japan and the United States. Countries that have a less diverse or homogeneous population seem to be less open and active in accepting immigrants when compared to those with heterogeneous population. In most cases, a population is not the only factor that influences the countries’ actions and decisions. However, there is a noticeable amount of relevancy and significance especially when two countries are compared. There are definitely different factors such as whether the country is developed or not, the type of political regime, etc. Nonetheless, the population of a country is surely an extremely relevant factor. In addition to the stated factors, there are also the policies of the different hosting countries. Japan has a very strict immigration policy and the law from its establishment was not designed to encourage migrants to settle in the country. The nationality law also implies reduction of acquisition of Japanese nationality by resident foreigners. On the other hand, the “Immigration and Naturalization Act of the United States of America”, the laws governing the current immigration policy, provides for an annual limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants.</p>
    <p> Overall, it is very evident that there are many different existing factors that influence the intake of different countries’ immigrants. Where, primarily homogeneous countries are less friendly and less open to immigrants whereas primarily heterogeneous countries take in more immigrants.</p>

    <h2><b>How Are Refugee Camps Used?</b></h2>
    <h3>Noella Kalasa</h3>
    <p> 53% of refugees come from Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria, with Syria currently having 4.9 million of its people seeking refugee status or asylum in other countries. Over half of the 21.3 million refugees in the world are minors. The Middle East and Africa collectively host 68% of the world’s 65.3 million people forced from their homes due to violence, economic plight, and environmental instability.</p>
    <p> Over 272,764 refugees have fled to the five camps in Kenya, which make up the Dadaab refugee complex. Three of these camps, Ifo, Dagahaley and Hagadera, which, as of 2015 are home to more than 277,310 migrants, have seen families grow and remain in the camps since 1990. The largest refugee camp in the world, Kakuma, is also in Kenya. Established in 1992, it is home to over 184,500 migrants, for the most part from South Sudan and Somalia. Kakuma and 7 other refugee camps in East Africa are members of the 10 largest in the world. Mishamo and Katumba, in Tanzania, together are home to 128,680 migrants. Camps Pugindo in Ethiopia and Yida in South Sudan have a combined population of 133,593. Countries bordering those experiencing violent conflict are the first places for refugees to go. Somali and Sudanese refugees flee to camps in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, Afghan refugees to Pakistan, Syrian refugees to Jordan and Turkey. Turkey as a nation hosts the most displaced people, with over 2.5 million men, women and children currently seeking refuge throughout the country. In 2014, Turkey hosted about 25% of refugees from neighboring Syria.</p>
    <p> An important factor in the financing and quality of refugee camps is whether they are refugee settlements or managed refugee camps. Refugee settlements are born when groups of migrants decide to seek safety in another territory and turn it into their own camp, self-governed and organized. In self- settled camps, governments and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees have no official responsibility for the migrants, and cannot easily assure safe conditions for the migrants. In these cases, the refugees receive aid but have to create economic and environmental stability for themselves. Planned refugee camps, on the other hand, are managed by governments in conjunction with NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The UNHCR has in place “guidance notes [which] outline the minimum standards required to ensure planned settlements enable refugee communities to live with security and dignity in a healthy environment which improves their quality of life”. In the Dadaab camps, the CARE agency provides primary schooling, food, as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene relief to migrants. Other NGOs provide similar services in other refugee camps.</p>
    <p> Most of the 15.4 million refugees in 2014 had been in camps for at least five years. After a while, in both settlement and planned camps, migrants begin to create their own hubs of activity, through agriculture, pastoralism, or starting businesses, and by creating spaces where individuals can learn and express themselves. The Hagadera Camp, one of the five in the Dadaab Complex, has a strong economy fueled by its market, one of the largest in the region. Migrants of the camp have moved to the outskirts and settled there. In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, soccer leagues and circus academy are offered as recreational outlets for the migrants. Humans, even in the direst conditions, adapt and make the best of what they have.</p>

    <h2><b>What are Policies for Integration of Migrants?</b></h2>
    <h3>Isabelle Jaber</h3>
    <p> The immigration policies worldwide are dependent on the size, economic strength and culture of a country. These factors as well as a country’s ability to provide temporary relief as opposed to permanent residence contribute to the difficulties of creating universal immigration policies. For example, Canada, Japan, Australia, and Saudi Arabia are countries with high levels of immigration and different immigration policies.</p>
    <p> Canada has very lenient immigration policies. To combat a shortage of skilled labor that has been stifling the country's economic growth since the 1970s, Canada has adopted one of the most open immigration policies in the world. As of 2010, the foreign-born population makes up 21.3 percent of the country's total population. On April 1, the already immigration-friendly country launched a Start-up Visa Program in an effort to attract highly skilled foreign entrepreneurs. Immigrants with funding from Canadian venture capital firms or investment groups for a start-up business will be eligible for immediate, permanent residency. If the new business fails, the entrepreneur will not be subject to deportation.</p>
    <p> On the other side of the spectrum, Japan has intensely strict immigration laws in place. In this country, favoring a racially homogenous society, the foreign population accounted for only 1.7 percent of the total population in 2010. Like Canada, Japan is facing a rapidly declining population in which the low birthrate can barely match the death rate of the country's senior citizens. The population now sits at 128 million, but analysts estimate the number will have shrunk by a third in 2060 forcing the country to embrace more open immigration policies. Following the examples of Canada and the United Kingdom, Japan rolled out a new point-based system in the spring of 2012 to rate immigrants. Immigrants earn points based on their academic background and research or business experience, among other factors. Those who score higher—mainly professionals like professors, doctors, and corporate managers—will be given preferential treatment.</p>
    <p> While Australia does have very standard immigration policies, what happens to immigrants whose visa expires is very drastic. In 2012, Australia received a total of nearly 15,800 asylum claims, up 37 percent from the previous year, according to the United Nations. The country's Department of Immigration and Citizenship states that the Migration Act 1958 requires any noncitizen or person who is unlawfully in Australia to be detained. People without a valid visa are considered unlawful—including children. Migrant children, especially asylum seekers, have been detained in immigration detention centers for months or even years. The Australian Government has responded to human rights complaints by removing children from detention centers and into community detention, or local housing.</p>
    <p> Saudi Arabia, another country with high levels of immigration, has announced a racially based immigration policy, which includes a rule that non- Saudis who marry Saudis will never gain citizenship and will always remain foreigners, as will their children. The new policy is aimed at preserving Saudi Arabia’s Semitic homogeneity. According to the new rules, first published in the Al Eqtisadiah newspaper, Saudi nationals need to fulfill all the requirements on a 17 point list before their applications to take a foreign spouse will even be considered—and even then, the granting of permission is not automatic. They also prescribe age restrictions for non-Saudi spouses. A Saudi man has to be between 40 and 65 years old, and a non-Saudi woman has to be between 30 and 55 years old before their application to live in Saudi Arabia can even be considered. A Saudi woman also has to be between 30 and 55 if she wants to take a non-Saudi husband, according to new rules.</p>

    <h2><b>What are US Immigration Policies of 2017?</b></h2>
    <h3>Anya Patel</h3>
    <p> The immigration policies of the United States of America have been dramatically changing with Donald Trump as president. He was recently elected as the 45th President of the United States and has already begun to take action. This recent change in presidency is affecting a lot of what America was attempting to achieve- specifically, diversity and integration. With the current refugee crisis in Syria, migration has become a very topical issue. The current process for refugees to enter the United States is already quite strict and even more strict for Syrian refugees. There are about 18 steps (20 steps for Syrian refugees) that they must undergo: background checks, interviews, fingerprint screenings, and security checks. This process often takes about 2 years to complete. On Friday, January 27, 2017 an executive order was placed to temporarily suspend citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria for 90 days and to suspend all refugees from entering the United States for 120 days. However, Syrian refugees will be suspended indefinitely. Evidently, this would affect many migration patterns and displace even more migrants. This executive order has thrown thousands of refugees seeking to become immigrants in the United States into disarray. In fact, the day after this order was placed (Saturday, January 28, 2017) more than 200 inbound foreigners with once valid U.S. visas were detained on account of the ban. It is estimated that under this order the number of refugees allowed in the United States in 2017 will decrease from 110,000 to 50,000. In addition, Trump will be prioritizing persecuted Christians because he strongly believes that they carry a burden by living in Muslim oriented countries. In an interview with David Brody, Trump said, “Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible—at least very, very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim, you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible. And I thought it was very, very unfair, so we are going to help them”. However, according to a data analysis by Pew Research Center only 1,380 more Muslim refugees were admitted into the United States than Christian refugees in 2016. This small increase in Muslim refugees is due to the recent Syrian refugee crisis because overall there have been more Christian refugees admitted into the United States since 2002.</p>
    <p> Donald Trump claims that the reasoning behind this order is for security purposes. Before signing the executive order at the Pentagon on Friday, January 27, 2017 Trump said, “I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people”. Trump has singled out these seven countries because three of them - Sudan, Syria, and Iran - are apart of the State Department’s list of sponsors of terrorism. The other four - Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Iraq - are “terrorist safe havens” according to the State Department.</p>

  <p> In a world undergoing technological, demographic, and environmental change, migration will be an ongoing hardship for many. In efforts to educate and inform, especially during these times under the influence of the current US administration, we, the UNIS UN executive committee, invited these speakers to help you answer these questions or force you to think about the information you receive on a daily basis. We hope that each speaker has provided you with a unique perspective regarding migration.</p>
  <p> The purpose of this year’s Working Paper is to explore the impact of migration on the world. We hope to be a foundation that allows you to begin your own discussions, raise awareness, share your knowledge with school’s in your respective countries, and perhaps create solutions to some of the issues discussed. We hope that the articles presented in this year’s Working Paper enhance your understanding of migration and its influence on the world around us.</p>
