	Currently, the members of the UNIS-UN Organizing Group are divided
	into six commissions:

<p>
	Each commission is led by two to three junior or senior heads. Together, these commission
	heads form a coordinating team known as the Executive Committee (EXCOMM).
</p>
<p>
	Preparations for the conference begin a year in advance, and include: finding and
	researching a contemporary global issue; selecting and inviting speakers; inviting
	several hundred students from national and international schools around the world
	and arranging for the majority of their accommodations with UNIS families; selecting 
	students to partake in the conference Student Panel and Debate; and compiling a Working 
	Paper of articles on the conference topic written by members of the UNIS-UN Organizing
	Committee and then edited by the UNIS-UN Editing Commission.
