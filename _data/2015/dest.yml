  Every year since 1976, UNIS-UN has organized and held a student-run conference, which over seven hundred high school students, from both the United Nations International School in New York and international and national high schools from around the world, attend. The structure of the UNIS-UN Conference in our 39th year is designed to provide students with expert knowledge through the voices of engaging guest speakers. We hope that you are willing to express your ideas in a forthright manner and provide insight in regard to the conference theme.

This year's conference topic will be Sustainability: Balancing People, Planet and Profit. The Millennium Development Goals, which targeted extreme poverty, health, and education in developing countries are coming to an end in 2015. The newest set of targets, the Sustainable Development Goals, build upon their predecessors and provide the framework for further improvements. As countries gather at the United Nations to reevaluate the MDGs and agree upon the new SDGs, it is the perfect time to explore what a sustainable future looks like and what is currently being done to achieve it. The 2015 UNIS-UN international student conference will examine sustainability in terms of its three interrelated components: the development of our society, the growth of the economies and the impact on the environment. We seek to explore topics such as climate justice, gender equality, and resilient cities, and to uncover how they are all key parts of fostering sustainable development on all levels. Through diverse speakers and open dialogue discussions we hope to engage young minds in the importance and possibilities of designing our sustainable and promising future.

In past years, we have been honored with addresses by distinguished individuals such as H.E. Mr. Ban Ki-moon, current Secretary-General of the United Nations; H.E. Mr. Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations; Richard Butler, former Chief Weapons Inspector to the United Nations; Hillary Clinton, current United States Secretary of State; global-warming activist Laurie David; founder of One Laptop per Child, Nicholas Negroponte; and H.E. Ms. Samantha Power, US Ambassador to the United Nations. In addition, many human rights advocates such as Danny Glover, Harry Belafonte, Vanessa Redgrave, and actor-director Morgan Spurlock have spoken at past UNIS-UN conferences. Previous conference topics include: BioEthics: Striking a Balance (2010), The Web: Wiring Our World (2011), Human Exploitation: Exposing the Unseen (2012), Modern Youthquake: A Generationâ€™s Impact (2013), and most recently Globalization: A World of Exchange (2014).
