  This year's conference topic will be Mediaâ€™s Influence: Opinions, Activism, and Outcomes. In modern society, media has a huge impact on the world's politics, businesses, and social dialogue. The 2016 UNIS-UN international student conference will examine the influence of media on perspectives, actions, and social changes in today's society. We seek to explore topics such as propaganda in media, media's role in social reform, and raising awareness, as well as the trends media creates. Social Media enables businesses to advertise their products in a cheap and effective way to enhance brand image and popularity. In addition, Social Media has inspired mass movements and political unrests in many countries. On the other hand, traditional forms of media such as television, newspapers, and magazines have also had a huge influence on our international relations, while enabling the consumer to be exposed to a completely new perspective.

In past years, we have been honored with addresses by distinguished individuals such as United Nations Secretary General, H.E. Mr. Ban Ki-moon; former United Nations Secretary General, H.E. Mr. Kofi Annan; former United Nations weapons inspector, Richard Butler; co-founder and chairman of the Gapminder Foundation, Hans Rosling; Former United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton; executive director of the United Nations Global Compact, Georg Kell; global-warming activist Laurie David; founder of One Laptop per Child, Nicholas Negroponte; and US Ambassador to the United Nations, H.E. Ms. Samantha Power. In addition, many human rights advocates such as Danny Glover, Harry Belafonte, Vanessa Redgrave, and actor-director Morgan Spurlock have spoken at past UNIS-UN conferences.
