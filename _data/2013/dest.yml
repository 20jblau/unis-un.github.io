 This coming year’s conference, to be held on March 7-8, 2013, is centered on change within a generation. Modern Youthquake: A Generation’s Impact, describes what we want the conference to be in only so many words. We have a vision of making this conference one that attendees can look back and think, “I was inspired to change my world.” We hope to encourage attendees this year to think more deeply into what they believe and what they want to do by inviting speakers who have somehow made a difference in their world which in turn impacted our world, and more importantly our generation. 

 We are aiming to find dynamic speakers, who can describe how they chose to make a difference in their lives and in the lives of others through a passion that they have. We want to show each student in attendance that we as a generation don’t need to sit around and wait for other people to make the world a better place to live; we want to show them that we are called to make a difference, that we can be part of a generation’s impact. And just like the youth of the 60s, we want to prove that we can change our world, just by doing.
