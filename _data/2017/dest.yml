  Your Executive Committee is excited to announce that this year's conference will be titled Migration: Crossing the Line! We will examine varying perspectives on the issues surrounding migration: the causes, individual experiences as well as the political and humanitarian responses to migration. While we may not find express answers to these issues, we hope to lead a discussion that can result in a deeper understanding of global migration. Stay tuned for more updates!
