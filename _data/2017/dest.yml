  This year's conference topic will be Migration: Crossing the Line, which will focus on the global movement of people. This issue currently holds the international spotlight as migration has and will continue to impact countries around the globe through a variety of forms. The 2017 UNIS-UN international student conference will examine varying perspectives on the issues surrounding migration: the causes, individual experiences as well as the political and humanitarian responses to migration. As millions of people flee their countries to escape armed conflict, political turmoil and economic hardships, we will consider who is responsible for providing aid and to what extent. While we may not find express answers to these issues, we hope to lead a discussion that can result in a deeper understanding of global migration.
