 This coming year's conference, to be held on March 6-7, 2014 is Globalization: A World of Exchange. We will examine the socio-cultural effects and repercussions of an increasingly interconnected world. As young people who have grown up in a world more interdependent than ever before, it is important for us to come together to learn about and discuss the new socio-cultural landscape of the world we will inherit.
 
 We hope to do this through exploration and dialogue about issues such as the impact of social media on cross cultural ties, the displacement of refugees in war ravaged areas, and the effects of immigration.
 
 We are aiming to find dynamic speakers, who can describe how they chose to make a difference in their lives and in the lives of others through a passion that they have. This exchange of knowledge will be enriched by the sharing of perspectives of young minds from around the globe and cultivated by the presentations of speakers from various facets of the globalization issue in hopes of inspiring awareness and new outlooks on the state and future of our world.
