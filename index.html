      <h1> Welcome to UNIS-UN </h1>
      <p> Our goal as an organization is to provide an educationally and intellectually enriching experience for our peers from around the world while promoting globalism and cross-cultural exchange.</p>

      <p> Every year since 1976, UNIS-UN has organized and held a student-run conference, which over seven hundred high school students, from both the United Nations International School in New York and international and national high schools from around the world, attend. The structure of the UNIS-UN Conference in our 40th year is designed to provide students with expert knowledge through the voices of engaging guest speakers.  We hope that you are willing to express your ideas in a forthright manner and provide insight in regard to the conference theme.</p>
        
      <p>This year's conference topic will be Mediaâ€™s Influence: Opinions, Activism, and Outcomes. In modern society, media has a huge impact on the world's politics, businesses, and social dialogue. The 2016 UNIS-UN international student conference will examine the influence of media on perspectives, actions, and social changes in today's society. We seek to explore topics such as propaganda in media, media's role in social reform, and raising awareness, as well as the trends media creates. Social Media enables businesses to advertise their products in a cheap and effective way to enhance brand image and popularity. In addition, Social Media has inspired mass movements and political unrests in many countries. On the other hand, traditional forms of media such as television, newspapers, and magazines have also had a huge influence on our international relations, while enabling the consumer to be exposed to a completely new perspective.</p>
      
      <p>In past years, we have been honored with addresses by distinguished individuals such as United Nations Secretary General, H.E. Mr. Ban Ki-moon; former United Nations Secretary General, H.E. Mr. Kofi Annan; former United Nations weapons inspector, Richard Butler; co-founder and chairman of the Gapminder Foundation, Hans Rosling; Former United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton; executive director of the United Nations Global Compact, Georg Kell; global-warming activist Laurie David; founder of One Laptop per Child, Nicholas Negroponte; and US Ambassador to the United Nations, H.E. Ms. Samantha Power. In addition, many human rights advocates such as Danny Glover, Harry Belafonte, Vanessa Redgrave, and actor-director Morgan Spurlock have spoken at past UNIS-UN conferences.</p>
